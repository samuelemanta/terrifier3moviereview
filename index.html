    <h1>Terrifier 3 - Movie Review</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Terrifier 3</strong> was my first horror movie experience, even though it falls under the slasher and splatter horror genre rather than pure horror.
        The movie is packed with bloodbaths rather than typical scary scenes, but that’s exactly what makes it a unique part of the horror genre.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Watched Terrifier 3</h2>
    <p>
        I was initially drawn to this movie because of a glowing review from my favorite movie critic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@victorlaszlo88" target="_blank">Victorlazlo88</a>. He described
        <strong>Terrifier 3</strong> as a “gold” movie in today’s era, and praised it for its impressive box office results, unique style, and iconic character
        Art the Clown. He even compared Art to classic horror icons like Leatherface, calling it an extreme, violent film rare in the mainstream.

    <h2>First Viewing</h2>
    <p>
        My first time watching <strong>Terrifier 3</strong> was tough, given its intense and unexpected gore. However, I quickly noticed elements of
        cinematic mastery, especially in certain scenes and musical choices. <br>

        The shots of Sienna Shaw's new bedroom were especially stunning. Despite its graphic violence, I found myself appreciating the movie more and more.

    <h3>Second Viewing</h3>
    <p>
        On my second viewing, I was able to enjoy the movie even more. Knowing what was coming allowed me to focus on the details, like
        Art the Clown's facial expressions, movements, and dark humor. His character is simply unforgettable and his performance is perfect.

    <h2>Storyline & Connection to Other Films</h2>
    <p>
        After watching <strong>Terrifier 3</strong>, I decided I needed to watch <strong>Terrifier 2</strong> to better understand the story of the "final girl," Sienna Shaw.
        Her character fascinated me, and I’m eager to see how her story unfolds.
